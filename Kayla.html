    <p>Dear Kayla,</p>
    <p class="love-note">I love you more than words can express.</p>
    <p>Since the day we met, my life has been filled with happiness, joy, and love.</p>
    <p>You are my sunshine on rainy days and the reason I smile when I wake up in the morning.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being by my side through thick and thin.</p>
    <p>With you, I've found the true meaning of love and I cherish every moment we spend together.</p>
    <p>Here's to many more beautiful moments and memories with you.</p>
    <p id="heart">❤️</p>
    <p>Love always,</p>
    <p>Jonathan</p>
